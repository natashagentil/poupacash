poupacash
=========

This project is about a simple app to control and manage my own money. 

The technologies used in this project are: mysql, php, Balsamiq, Photoshop, MAMP, Sublime.
Unfortunately not this in MVC yet, but the future is longing to make this system more organized and standards projects.
You can contribute with suggestions, criticisms and compliments adding features that will leave poupacash more beautiful
and functional. 
The original idea was to create a toy system for basic control of own spending and mainly functioned without internet 
connection and use it in my phone.

About the technical aspects: 
System features Poupacash 1.0 (being tested): 
-> Insertion income and spending (CRUD); 
-> New user form; 
-> Login; 
-> Subtraction operation income - expense and visualization of expenses and how much income still owns; 
-> Spending separated by fixed or variable; 
-> Form of payment. 

Desired features for the next version: 
-> Graphical spending and income per month; 
-> Graphical separated by category showing% in each; 
-> Control by week, month and year of spending.
